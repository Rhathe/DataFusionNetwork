1) These files were set up up in OMNET++ 4+.

This program is found in http://www.omnetpp.org/

2) This also uses the MIXIM framework, which must be imported to OMNET++

MIXIM can be found in http://mixim.sourceforge.net/

3) An extentention of the MIXIM framework was also used to control the radios.

This can be downloaded and copied over the MIXIM files from here: https://github.com/olafur/mixim

4) When OMNET is running, open the myWSN.ned file and press the run button. There should be three modes.

"Alt" is my proposed scheme. "Negative" is the silent negative voting scheme. "Time" is the time-slotted voting scheme.

5) Running these will open two windows. You can press run on the animation window and you can see the network running with animations of the nodes and packets.

In the other window with text there is an express button. Pressing that will make the simulation run fast enough to finish. The simulation will end in 10000 simulation seconds.

6) The results of the simulation will be stored in the results folder. They can be analyzed in OMNET++ using the analysis.anf file.
